# Modern Web Development with Scala

This is a `giter8` template that provides the skeleton of an example application that we will be building over the course of the [Modern Web Development with Scala](https://leanpub.com/modern-web-development-with-scala) book. The template is loosely based on the "play-scala" Activator template but it's much simpler.

## Quick start

If you have `sbt` 0.13.13 or higher installed, you can initialize a new project from this template easily:

```sh
sbt new denisftw/play-scala-web-starter.g8
```

It will prompt you to type a project name and then initialize the project in a new directory.

## Versions used

The code uses Play 2.6, Scala 2.12 along with sbt 1.2.
